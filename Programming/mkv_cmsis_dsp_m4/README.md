# Performance of DSP operations on Microcontrollers
This example investigates the performance of a DSP operation on an Arm Cortex M4 MCU (KV46F256 from NXP) 
using CMSIS DSP library. A simple example of an element-wise vector multiplication is provided and 
the operation performance is measured as number of clock cycles.

The software project is developed in MCUXpresso IDE.
