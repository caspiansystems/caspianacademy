# Design pattern in C: state machine
This repo directory provides an example of a statemachine design pattern in C that can handle the state machine complexity while being scalable and provide a good level of encapsulation. 
The pattern itself is not the author's design and can be found in various embedded software applications. The example is implemented in Visual Studio in Windows 10.
